**Describe the feature**
A clear and concise description of what the problem/feature is.

Example:

I want to use multi-tape Turing machine.

Better example, explaining the reason for the feature:

It's difficult to write algorithms for 2d problems on a classical Turing machine. A multi-tape Turing machine would make solving such problems easier.

**Describe alternatives you've considered (optional)**
A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.
